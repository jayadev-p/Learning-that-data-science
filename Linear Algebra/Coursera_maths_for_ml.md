# Mathematics for Machine Learning (Coursera)

## Module 2 - Vectors are objects that move around space

### Modulus & inner product

Dot product is commutative, distributive over addition, associate over scalar multiplication
Dot product of vector by itself is magnitude of vector squared

### Cosine & dot product

Idea: Dot product of 2 vecotors shows the degree similarity between vectors.
Orthogonal vectors have 0 dot product
Vectors in similar directions have postive dot product. Vectors in opposite directions have negative dot product.
