## 1.  Geometry of linear equations
Row Form - Ax = b

Column Form - Linear equation of vectors


## 2.  Elimination with matrices
Multiply 1st equation by a certain amount and subtract from second equation such that fist co-eff is zero recursively  
Pivots (non zero co-effs represented as diagonals in elimination method)  
Backward substitution for solution

> Matrix Multiplication
> > Matrix \* Column/vector = column/vector
> > row vector \* matrix = row vector
> > matrix \* matrix = matrix (multiply row of left with column of right)
