## 1.  Geometry of linear equations
Row Form - Ax = b

Column Form - Linear equation of vectors


## 2.  Elimination with matrices
Multiply 1st equation by a certain amount and subtract from second equation such that fist co-eff is zero recursively  
Pivots (non zero co-effs represented as diagonals)

Backward substitution for solution
