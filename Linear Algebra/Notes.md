## 1.  Geometry of linear equations
Row Form - Ax = b

Column Form - Linear equation of vectors


## 2.  Elimination with matrices
Multiply 1st equation by a certain amount and subtract from second equation such that fist co-eff is zero recursively  
Pivots (non zero co-effs represented as diagonals in elimination method)  
Backward substitution for solution

> Matrix Multiplication  
> Matrix \* Column/vector = column/vector  
> row vector \* matrix = row vector  
> matrix \* matrix = matrix (multiply row of left with column of right)

Elimination process can be represented as multipling a Elimination matrix to my Co-eff matrix recursively

Idea of permutation matrix (exchange rows/columns of a matrix)  

A \* B <> B \* A  
Multiplying on left side is not the same as multiplying on right side  
Left side multiplication operates on rows of the original matrix  
Right side multiplication operates on column of the original matrix  
Idea of Identity matrix and inverse matrix 

## 3.  Multiplication and Inverse matrices
1.  Row of left to column of right (dot product)
2.
